I am currently a Master’s student at the University of Lyon 2, conducting my M2 internship under the supervision of Jordan Navarro. My research focuses on how a driver’s perceived agency influences their brain activation patterns.

I am deeply attracted by the interaction between humans and advanced technology. I believe this research is essential in our current era, as technology evolves and reshapes our daily interactions.
