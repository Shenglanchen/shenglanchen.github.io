# Master's thesis
I'm working on 2 master thesis which studied the Human-Autonomous Car Interaction at the EMC Lab (Lyon 2). Full thesis details and results will be uploaded here shortly. Stay tuned!

➡️ Thesis 1 : 
This study employs functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate how the human brain processes and infers intentions. By comparing interactions with human agents versus artificial agents (specifically automated vehicles), the research explores whether the neural mechanisms of social cognition differ when the "other" is a machine.

➡️ Thesis 2: 
This study employs fNIRS too. It examines neural patterns before, during, and after the resumption of manual control of car, investigating how different levels of automation influence cognitive and neural activation.
