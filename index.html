<p>
Hi, I'm Shenglan. I am a master student conducting my M2 internship of Human-Computer Interaction at the <a href="https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/">EMC</a> (Université Lumière Lyon 2).
<p>
Driven by a curiosity about how research can be applied in the industry, I am actively seeking a CIFRE thesis for the next 3 years (2026–2029). My goal is to continue exploring fascinating human-machine interactions in a practical industrial context.
<p>
You can find more details about my background and my latest research in the  <a href="https://shenglanchen.github.io/aboutme/">About Me</a>  and  <a href="https://shenglanchen.github.io/Projects/">Projects</a> sections.
